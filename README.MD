# DOCKER VOLUMES
Docker volumes are a powerful feature that allows you to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers.
They provide a way to store data outside of the container's filesystem, ensuring that the data remains intact even if the container is removed or recreated.

There are two main types of Docker volumes:
1. **Named Volumes**: These are managed by Docker and can be created using the `docker volume create` command.
Named volumes are stored in a part of the host filesystem which is managed by Docker (`/var/lib/docker/volumes/` on Linux). 
They are easy to use and are the preferred way to persist data in Docker.

#### How to manage named volumes:
- Create a volume: `docker volume create my_volume`
- List volumes: `docker volume ls`
- Inspect a volume: `docker volume inspect my_volume`
- Remove a volume: `docker volume rm my_volume`

- Create a volume alongside with docker run:
```bash
    docker run -d -v my_volume:/path/in/container my_image
```
- Example of running a container with a named volume:
```bash
    docker run -d -p 3000:80 --rm --name feedback-app -v feedback:/app/feedback feedback-node:volume
```

2. **Bind Mounts**: These allow you to mount a file or directory from the host filesystem into a container. 
Bind mounts can be useful for development purposes, as they allow you to directly access and modify files on the host system from within the container.



## Creating a Volume
You can create a Docker volume using the following command:
```bash
docker volume create my_volume
```
