# DOCKER VOLUMES
Docker volumes are a powerful feature that allows you to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers.
They provide a way to store data outside of the container's filesystem, ensuring that the data remains intact even if the container is removed or recreated.

## Creating a Volume
You can create a Docker volume using the following command:
```bash
docker volume create my_volume
```
